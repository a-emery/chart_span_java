# chart_span_java

I was given the task to create a function that will convert ip addresses into integers. Eventually I would like to complete this in java, but this is written in JS. The first input uses code I wrote to convert the ip chunks into binary and eventually combine these into an integer. The second uses the built in parseInt() and toString() methods to do the conversions, creating cleaner code, but not as fun to write.
